# 🕵️‍♀️ Crime Analysis in India 🇮🇳

This project presents an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of crime patterns across Indian cities. Using real-world crime data, the analysis uncovers significant insights about the nature, frequency, and distribution of crimes, with a particular focus on gender-based crimes and urban safety.

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze the crime dataset from Indian cities to:

- Understand the **geographical spread** of crimes
- Identify trends in **crime against women**
- Compare crime rates across **states and cities**
- Reveal patterns using **univariate** and **multivariate** visualizations
- Provide **actionable insights** for policy-makers and the public

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- **Language**: Python  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries Used**:  
  `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Sklearn`

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Name**: `crime_dataset_india.csv`  
- **Source**: [Add source link if available, or write “Confidential / Academic Dataset”]  
- **Shape**: `X rows × Y columns`  
- **Features include**:
  - City, State
  - Year of incident
  - Crime type
  - Victim gender and age
  - Crime count / occurrence

## 📈 Key Analysis Performed

- 🔹 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- 🔹 **Univariate Analysis** (crime type, location, gender)
- 🔹 **Multivariate Analysis** (city vs gender, state vs crime rate)
- 🔹 **Heatmaps, Count Plots, Grouped Bar Charts, Pivot Tables**
- 🔹 **Insights and Visual Storytelling**

## 🌟 Sample Insights

- **Delhi and Mumbai** report the highest number of crimes against women.
- Urban areas show a higher concentration of **gender-based crimes**, especially in Tier-1 cities.
- Some southern cities like **Chennai** also show elevated crime counts.
- There's a rising trend in reported cases over the years in specific states.
